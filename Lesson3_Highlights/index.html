            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Using a version control system is very useful. After studying this I really wished I learned about it sooner. The laptop I am using right now has several versions of research papers, projects, and resumes. If I was using a version control system, it would help me save all the versions while being more organized at the same time. It is also important other scenarios as well. For example, if two employees are trying to edit the same document at the same time. Without a version control system, overriding each other’s work can occur which can be a very frustrating situation to be in. If the system is implemented, then the risk of things being overridden in shared projects can be avoided. Users can also work on the same project simultaneously and can revert to a previous state of the project.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are very important. There are three types VCSs, but which one is the best? A local version control system has a simple database that stores all the changes to files under revision control. This type helps users avoid using the wrong directory and editing the wrong files. A centralized control system has a database where all versions of files are stored, and multiple people have access to it. This type is important when working on a project with a group. Each person in the group has access to the files in the database and can work on the files simultaneously. The only problem is if the server crashes or the database becomes corrupted, then a lot of work can be lost. A distributed version control system eliminates lost work. In this type there is a database and each user have its own repository therefore a user’s computer stores all versions of files in their computer, so no files can get lost.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Before its creation, developers who built Linux Kernel created a distributed version control service called BitKeeper. The relationship between the community that developed Linux Kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper was severed. This led the Linux developers to make a new version control using what they learned creating BitKeeper. They developed Git. Their goals when making the new version control was for it have fast speeds, a simple design, support of non-linear development, to be fully distributed, and be able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently. When Git was released all their goals were became reality. Their newest version control system was everything they wanted.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is light weight and extremely fast. This is important when using any kind of version control system. It has the ability to give users all the history of edits and changes that are made to projects whether that be graphics, designs, documents, or even code. Git truly caters to collaborative users. Users that are working together on a project have the power to edit files, see other user’s edits, and work on files simultaneously. It is very simple to use for any type of user regardless of knowledge or experience. This implementation of a version control system will truly help get the job done. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Why use Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is different compared to other implementations of version control. Other version control systems need a complicated server setup. Git is different because it is locally enabled. This means that users can version control a project on their own desktops. Git is designed for team collaboration. A team can easily edit the same project no matter the size of the team. Team members can even edit files at the same time. Teammates edit their files and have the ability to merge the files together which creates a new file with both of the teammates’ changes. Git is good for any level of version control users. It can help both advanced users and beginners. </p>
